FizzBuzz is a classic interview question usually done at the whiteboard. We're going to create a Java implementation.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Bonus: For every third Fizz print Fizzy! and for every fourth Buzz print Buzzy! and for every third FizzBuzz make up your own word or phrase.
